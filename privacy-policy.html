    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 10, 2024</p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>Resume Wizard</strong>, an open-source platform that builds resumes based on LinkedIn profiles. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your personal information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>To generate a resume, our application collects the following information from your LinkedIn profile, with your explicit consent:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Profile picture</li>
        <li>Job title and professional headline</li>
        <li>Work experience</li>
        <li>Education history</li>
        <li>Skills and endorsements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect or store any additional personal information beyond what is necessary to create your resume.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information collected from LinkedIn is used solely to generate a resume for you. We do not share, sell, or rent your information to third parties. All data is processed in real-time and is not stored on our servers.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our application integrates with LinkedIn’s API to retrieve profile information. Your use of LinkedIn is governed by LinkedIn's privacy policies and terms. We encourage you to review their policies to understand how your data is handled by LinkedIn.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since we do not store your data, it is processed securely and then discarded after the resume is generated. As this is an open-source project, we encourage users to review the code and contribute to further security improvements.</p>

    <h2>5. Open-Source Contribution</h2>
    <p><strong>Resume Wizard</strong> is available for developers to fork and improve on GitHub. Any contributions must adhere to our privacy and data protection guidelines.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not store any personal information, no further action is needed after the resume is generated. If you wish to revoke our access to your LinkedIn data, you can do so through LinkedIn’s privacy settings.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or relevant regulations. Please review this page regularly to stay informed.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <strong>help@jamesflores.dev</strong>.</p>
